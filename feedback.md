 ## Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **3: Excelling.** Your app is deployed successfully, however, it seems the version on the master branch
 is behind the one deployed on the gh-pages one. Ensure your sync them up.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **2: Performing.** More than surpassed the minimal requirements. You definitely pushed yourself here! I would
 suggest exploring adding new features such as a timer or allowing players to choose different numbers of
 disks to play with.

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **3: Excelling.** Code quality is very good. You organized your data well and tied your data to the DOM neatly. There are a few opportunities to break functions up and make your code more modular, but overall
 excellent and clean code.

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **2: Performing.** Your interface, particularly the use of jQuery UI for dragging and dropping is impressive. I would suggest adding a few new elements to your interface such as a win notification box and making sure that your app can handle page resize.
